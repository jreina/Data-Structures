# Data-Structures
Trying data structures programming with C# and TDD.

### What is this?
This is mostly a learning exercise for myself.

### What is this not?
This is not meant to be a stable implementation of any of the included data structures. These structures will almost certainly have greater overhead and implement less efficient algorithms than things like the System.Collections.Generic.LinkedList class.

### Why?
I am currently taking a data structures class and it has proven to be a bit of a challenge.
Part of the challenge is due to the fact that the class is taught using c++ and I do not write c++ on a regular basis.
In order to better understand these structures and perhaps to improve upon my original implementations (which have been quite kludgy so far), I have chosen to take a crack at the same assignments in C# using managed code in a safe context, while utilizing TDD to track improvments and progress.
